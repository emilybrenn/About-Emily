What I'm Up to Lately:

🎩 Top of mind: The Arthur C. Clarke quote “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic” came up at a conference last week in regards to AI enhancements. I'm thinking alot though on how we can be productive and harder / better / faster / stronger in our current workflows with AI…but that the true magic happens when we can use these tools to deliver coutcome-oriented customer experiences with transformational intention.
